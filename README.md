# Solar Analysis: Initial exploratory data 

The following code and data are the result of just a few short hours of exploratory analysis. This data analysis attempts to find key insights from one month of personal solar data that my solar system has generated recently. The data was collected from Tesla's mobile app (which will be leveraged through unofficial API prompts in the future) and then compiled into one CSV file using pandas.

# Initial Finding: Grounds for Investigation

After reviewing my documentation, it is clear that my solar system is not yielding the maximum output, regardless of optimal conditions such as full sunshine, maximum light exposure, and the longest summer days. With further analysis, including merged weather/cloud API data, I will be able to correlate the system's output with my area's weather patterns, demonstrating that the system is underperforming. This, in turn, will enable me to show my company the need to reevaluate the system's hardware so that it can produce more energy throughout its lifetime.

# Next Phase: Calculating Potential Earnings

The state of Texas has a notoriously laissez-faire approach to consumer energy rights, and therefore does not enforce that my energy provider should pay for the energy I produce on their behalf or provide me with credits as compensation. This collected data lays the initial groundwork to leverage my legal options so that I can contest my current policy and negotiate future compensation.

# Conclusion

While this short project has only just begun, it outlines the next steps I will take to leverage my data and empower myself in my pursuit of energy independence. These data collection and storytelling skills are what I can bring to any energy organization that is ready to harness my passion and talents for a brighter future.
