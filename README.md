# Solar Analysis: Initial exploratory data 

The following code and data are the result of just a few short hours of exploratory analysis. This data analysis attempts to find key insights from one month of personal solar data that my solar system has generated recently. The data was collected from Tesla's mobile app (which will be leveraged through unofficial API prompts in the future) and then compiled into one CSV file using pandas.

# Initial Finding: Grounds for Investigation

After reviewing my documentation, it is clear that my solar system is not yielding the maximum output, regardless of optimal conditions such as full sunshine, maximum light exposure, and the longest summer days. With further analysis, including merged weather/cloud API data, I will be able to correlate the system's output with my area's weather patterns, demonstrating that the system is underperforming. This, in turn, will enable me to show my company the need to reevaluate the system's hardware so that it can produce more energy throughout its lifetime.

# Next Phase: Calculating Potential Earnings

The State of Texas does not currently have a buy-back mandate for solar production from pritately owned systems, meaning that there's also a considerable amount of money being made from energy exports from this system at a low or no cost to them. This collected data lays the initial groundwork to leverage my legal options so that I can contest my current policy and negotiate future compensation, possibly by switching plans based on buy-back rates.

# Conclusion

While this short project has only just begun, it outlines the next steps I will take to leverage my data and empower myself in my pursuit of energy independence. These data collection and storytelling skills are what I can bring to any energy organization that is ready to harness my passion and talents for a brighter future.
